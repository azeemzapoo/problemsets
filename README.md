In this repository i will add my solution to many coding question, especially in c++ and c++ OOP.

Q1: write the code in c++ to take a number in input and find the each digits for that number in the same order.

Q2: same question as Q1 just solve it using funcitons.

Q3: write the code to find if the number is plandromic number. plandromic number means a number is same as forward and backward.
